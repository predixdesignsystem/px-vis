  This is a bit funky:
  basically, we want to be able to dim our data series for crosshair and for cursors for some charts
  since both cursor and crosshair highlighting can happen at the same time,
  they need separate classes so as not to interfere with one another.

  Also, since the canvas and the layers svg live in different components, I'm putting them here so they are always accessible.
